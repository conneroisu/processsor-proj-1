# Processor Project 1

Due Oct 25th

| Criteria | Ratings | Pts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prelab: team contract was submitted and completely filled out | 5 pts | 5 pts |
| Problem 1: MIPS Single-Cycle Processor. 5 points for reasonable schematic; 5 points for VHDL file that reasonably matches schematic | 10 pts | 10 pts |
| Problem 2: Component Implementation a: 3 points for spreadsheet; 4 points for testbench and corresponding schematic; b: 3 points for description; 3 points for schematic and answer; 3 points for testbench and corresponding schematic c: 9 points for ALU -- equal points for reasonable components and total ALU design (all or nothing -- must have everything required, including testbenches, design schematics, question responses, waveforms, discussion, etc.) | 25 pts | 25 pts |
| Problem 3: Testing Each required test is equally weighted fraction of total points. If any part of waveform, annotation/discussion, or assembly file is missing, no points for that test. Full credit is given so long as the program reasonably meets the intended testing purpose (must successfully run in MARS, but not necessarily on processor). | 20 pts | 20 pts |                
| Problem 4: Synthesis 5 points for reporting a reasonable critical path that is tracked through their top-level modules (PC -> Memory -> reg file -> ALU -> Memory, etc), if not the specific signals of the design (PC bit 0 -> Memory address 0 -> reg file address A bit 0 -> register file mux select line bit 0 , etc). 5 points for Fmax | 10 pts | 10 pts |
| Correctness: 10 points * (Fraction of HW5 test cases that work) 5 points for every instruction test program entirely working (all or nothing) 10 points for bubblesort (and mergesort if $>4$ ) matching MARS (must have implementation working reasonably well in MARS to get points) (all or nothing) 5 points for Grendel.s entirely working | 30 pts | 30 pts |
